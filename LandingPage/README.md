Landing Page Project

This is a responsive landing page that I built as part of my internship project. The main goal of this project was to create a clean and modern website layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website contains a hero section, features section, about section, contact section, and a footer with social media links. I focused mainly on making the design responsive so that it works properly on desktop as well as mobile devices.

While building this project, I practiced writing structured HTML, organizing CSS properly, and using JavaScript to handle the mobile menu toggle and smooth scrolling navigation.
